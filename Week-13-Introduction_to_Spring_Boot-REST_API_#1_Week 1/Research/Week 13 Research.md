## Prompts:
1. What does REST stand for?  What is REST?  What are some of the key concepts that identify REST?
    1. REST stands for Representational State Transfer.  It is an application protocol interface between clients and servers.  There are a lot of concepts that go along with REST, but here are a few:
    * The article I read describes the transactions as stateless, meaning the client and server do not need to have awareness of the state of the other.  All information needed to respond to the other is in the transaction.
    * The client and the server are completely independant.  Meaning you can change one or the other, or both, and as long as they still follow the protocol interface, they will still work together.  This also means they can be coded in different programming languages, or run on differing operating systems.

2. What is ARC?  Why would you use ARC?  What can you do with ARC?
    1. ARC stands for Advanced REST client.  You can use it to test your back-end application without having a front-end web page by manually entering your information in the tool.  You can inspect the responses and troubleshoot your code in an isolated manner which will help ensure your integration will run smoother.
